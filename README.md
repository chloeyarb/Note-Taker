## Description 

This weeks challenge takes a deep dive into creating an application that allows the user to take notes using Express.js on the back end. To accomplish a functioning application the developer used both HTML and API routes. The API routes consist of get, post, and delete requests to send and receive data from the server. Middleware functions are used to access the request and response objects. This application introduces the use of UUID to be able to generate a unqiue ID for each note. The ID is useful for making the delete requests on the back end, which allows for a user to delete a note. This challenge is quite rewarding to work on the back end and see a functioning application in the browser.     

## Installation

This requires the NPM installation, which will produce the node_module folder. This will allows access to the EXPRESS, FS, PATH, and UUID dependancies which were used in this application. 

Please note a .gitignore was used for this project.
